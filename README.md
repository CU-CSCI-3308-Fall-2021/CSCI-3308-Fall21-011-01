Project Description:
Boat or car is trying not to crash into obstacles that keep coming from one direction continually going faster and faster. The player will 
have a birds eye view of the game as if they are looking down at the vehicle. The game score will continue to go up until the Boat or car 
crashes, at which the game ends and its score leaderboard appears.

HTML for the web page (information and glue that holds things together)
CSS to stylize the page
