Organization & Structure:
Everything that isn't actual code for our website is organized into it's respective folders like our milestone submissions, pseudocodes for planning, and team meeting log.
The entire website is in the "Project" folder.
It is organized similary to the way our labs are organized.
The images we used are all stored in the "resources" folder. 
Javascript files are in the "Script" folder.
The tables that we reference in the server.js using sqlis stored in its own folder.
The majority of our project is in the "Views" folder.
It's where all of the ejs files are for the home, login, and all the games pages.
Additionally, we have a style folder for our css pages.
